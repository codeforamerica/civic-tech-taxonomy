description = "Information &amp; Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) is the practice of applying what we now simply call 'tech' to developing contexts. Examples include projects like <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/\">One Laptop Per Child</a> and SMS surveys to reach people in rural areas. ICT4D too often relies on outside intervention from well-meaning but non-local actors, and has been criticized as focusing on shiny new tech when longstanding underlying issues pose a graver threat to human development."
