# Welcome

The **Civic Tech Taxonomy** is a community-maintained set of records defining standard tags for categorizing civic technology projects across different databases and organizations.

Through `synonyms` that can be defined within each record for a standard tag, the taxonomy also functions as a map between terms commonly used organically and their standard equivalent.

## Source of truth

The [`codeforamerica/civic-tech-taxonomy`](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-taxonomy) repository on GitHub is the official source of truth for the standard taxonomy.

## Contributing

Contributions to the taxonomy should be suggested via pull request, reviewed by a volunteer maintainer, and then merged into the `master` branch upon acceptance.

## Format

Tags defined within the repository are stored in the [gitsheets format](https://docs.gitsheets.com/), and can be read with any [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) parser or higher-level gitsheets interface.
